# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Summary
This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to address Lighthouse audit findings.

## Issues Identified (Pre-Optimization)
- **Mobile Score**: 66/100
  - LCP: 66.4s (critical issue)
  - FCP: 2.9s
  - Speed Index: 5.2s
  
- **Desktop Score**: 73/100
  - LCP: 10.8s
  - FCP: 0.7s

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. ✅ Image Width/Height Attributes
**Issue**: Images lacked explicit dimensions, causing layout shifts and slower rendering
**Solution**: Added explicit `width` and `height` attributes to all images
- Home page hero portrait: 1200x1600
- Home page logo: 2000x800
- Carousel images: 800x600
- Footer logo: 48x48

**Impact**: Prevents CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) and helps browser allocate space before image loads

### 2. ✅ Code Splitting & Chunk Optimization
**Issue**: Large JavaScript bundles (127KB unused JS)
**Solution**: Implemented manual chunking strategy in `vite.config.ts`
```javascript
manualChunks: {
  'react-vendor': ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-router-dom'],
  'animation-vendor': ['gsap', 'framer-motion'],
  'ui-vendor': ['swiper'],
}
```

**Impact**: 
- Separate vendor bundles for better caching
- Reduced initial bundle size
- Faster subsequent page loads

### 3. ✅ Build Optimization
**Issue**: Unoptimized production builds
**Solution**: 
- Enabled CSS code splitting (`cssCodeSplit: true`)
- Added Terser minification with console removal
- Configured aggressive compression

**Impact**: Smaller bundle sizes, faster downloads

### 4. ✅ Image Loading Strategy
**Solution**: Optimized loading priorities
- Critical images (hero): `loading="eager"` + `fetchPriority="high"`
- Below-fold images: `loading="lazy"`
- Carousel first slide: `fetchPriority="high"`
- Subsequent slides: `loading="lazy"`

**Impact**: Faster LCP and FCP scores

## Remaining Recommendations (Deployment-Level)

### 1. Image Compression & Modern Formats
**Action Required**: Before deployment, compress images using tools like:
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - PNG/JPG compression
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) - Convert to WebP/AVIF formats
- Target: Reduce 20,695 KiB as identified in audit

**Expected Impact**: 50-70% reduction in image payload

### 2. CDN & Caching Headers
**Action Required**: Configure hosting platform (Lovable/Netlify/Vercel)
```
Cache-Control: max-age=31536000, immutable (for hashed assets)
Cache-Control: max-age=3600, must-revalidate (for HTML)
```

**Expected Impact**: Est. savings of 16,160 KiB on repeat visits

### 3. Image Conversion Script (Optional)
Consider creating a pre-build script to automatically:
- Convert PNG/JPG to WebP
- Generate responsive image sizes
- Create `<picture>` elements with fallbacks

### 4. Preconnect to External Resources
Add to `index.html` if using external fonts or APIs:
```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://analytics.google.com">
```

## Expected Performance Improvements
After implementing all optimizations:
- **Mobile**: 66 → 85+ (target)
- **Desktop**: 73 → 90+ (target)
- **LCP**: Should drop from 66.4s/10.8s to < 2.5s
- **FCP**: Should improve to < 1.8s (mobile) / < 1.0s (desktop)

## Monitoring
After deployment, re-run Lighthouse audit and compare:
1. Navigate to deployed URL
2. Open DevTools → Lighthouse
3. Generate report for Mobile & Desktop
4. Verify improvements in Core Web Vitals

## Next Steps for Further Optimization
1. Convert all large images to WebP format
2. Implement responsive images with `srcset`
3. Consider using a CDN for asset delivery
4. Enable Brotli compression on hosting platform
5. Implement service worker for offline caching (Progressive Web App)
